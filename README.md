## Installation

### Download (Easiest)

1. Download [ClipboardManager-1.0.dmg](../../releases)
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag ClipboardManager to Applications
4. **IMPORTANT:** Run this command in Terminal:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/ClipboardManager.app
   ```
5. Launch from Applications
6. Grant permissions if prompted

⚠️ **This app is unsigned.** macOS will block it without the command above. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions and alternatives.

**Why unsigned?** Code signing requires a $99/year Apple Developer account. For an open-source project, the command above is a simple alternative that tells macOS "I trust this app."

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0+
- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later

#### Building

```bash
cd ClipboardManager
swift build -c release
./create_app.sh
```

This creates `ClipboardManager.app` ready to install.

## Usage

1. **Copy text or images** - Clipboard Manager automatically saves them
2. **Click the menu bar icon** - View your clipboard history organized by day
3. **Press Cmd+Shift+V** - Open clipboard menu from anywhere
4. **Use Cmd+1 to Cmd+9** - Quickly paste recent items
5. **Select a clip** - Restores it to your clipboard
6. **Hover over items** - See preview tooltips
7. **Right-click items** - Pin or delete clips
8. **Search** - Open enhanced search window with filters and sorting
9. **Preferences** - Adjust retention period and manage history

## Security & Privacy

- ✅ **AES-256-GCM encryption** - Military-grade encryption for all clipboard data
- ✅ **macOS Keychain** - Encryption key stored securely in system keychain
- ✅ **Secure file permissions** - Database restricted to owner-only access (0600)
- ✅ **Local only** - No network access, all data stays on your Mac
- ✅ **Your data only** - Only accessible by your user account
- ✅ **Authenticated encryption** - Prevents tampering with encrypted data

Database location: `~/.clipboard_history.db`

For detailed security architecture, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Development

### Code Quality

This project uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to ensure code quality and consistency.

**Install SwiftLint:**
```bash
brew install swiftlint
```

SwiftLint runs automatically during builds via `create_app.sh`. You can also run it manually:
```bash
swiftlint
```
